# SchizoMail
A mail system for geeky schizophrenics - done as an exercise in object oriented programming.

With this mail app you can send mails between your personalities. Will never reveal your mailings to outsiders as the system is completely closed and doesn't save anything to disk. And you have to be a little geeky as it only works in the terminal.
